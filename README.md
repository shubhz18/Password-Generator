Password Generator App
A simple yet powerful Password Generator built with JavaScript. This app allows users to generate secure, random passwords with customizable length and character options. Itâ€™s a great tool for understanding the core concepts of JavaScript such as working with strings, loops, and user input handling.

Features
ðŸ”‘ Generate Secure Passwords: Create strong, random passwords with a click of a button.
ðŸŽ¯ Customizable Options: Choose the length and characters to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters).
ðŸ”’ Enhanced Security: Passwords are generated randomly, ensuring they're unique and hard to guess.
ðŸ“± Simple and Responsive UI: Easy-to-use interface, compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Random Password Generation Logic: Vanilla JavaScript
Getting Started
To get a local copy of the app running on your machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/shubhz18/Password-Generator.git
Navigate to the project directory

bash
Copy code
cd Password-Generator
Open the index.html file
Open the file in your browser to start using the app.

How It Works
The app generates a secure password based on user-selected criteria (password length and character types). The JavaScript logic randomly selects characters from each category to ensure the password is both secure and unique.

Learning Outcomes
While building this app, I enhanced my understanding of:

JavaScript Fundamentals: Understanding loops, conditionals, and string manipulation.
DOM Manipulation: How to interact with the web page through JavaScript.
Randomness in Programming: Implementing random password generation logic.
